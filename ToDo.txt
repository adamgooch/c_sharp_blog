To Do:

- User.Role - should this be a Role object as opposed to an int?
- Force unique email on User
- Do something better with the iteration count in the authenticator. Maybe some sort of struct for password, salt, and iteration count?
- Duplication in HomeController/Index and Filters/AuthorizeUser
- Write tests for Authenticator
- Write tests for UserInteractor
- Manage Users Page
- Make authorization cookie unique with every login
