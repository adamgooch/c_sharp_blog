To Do:

- Force unique email on User
- Do something better with the iteration count in the authenticator. Maybe some sort of struct for password, salt, and iteration count?
- Duplication in HomeController/Index and Filters/AuthorizeUser
- Write tests for Authenticator
- Write tests for UserInteractor
- Make authorization cookie unique with every login
- Fix error on Login of non-existent account
- Need logout button
- Authorization filter needs to check role (ie. Author for blog creation, Admin for user managing, etc.)
- Force authorization for Accout/EditRole action
- Make Account/Delete action a post, preferrably with an authorized Ajax call if it can be done without sending cookies
- Need flash messages (ie. delete user doesn't work)
- Ensure there are no spaces in urls (ie. blog titles)
- Add flash message to Ajax success and failure functions
