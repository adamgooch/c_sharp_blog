To Do:

- Force unique email on User
- Do something better with the iteration count in the authenticator. Maybe some sort of struct for password, salt, and iteration count?
- Duplication in HomeController/Index and Filters/AuthorizeUser
- Write tests for Authenticator
- Write tests for UserInteractor
- Make authorization cookie unique with every login
- Fix error on Login of non-existent account
- Need logout button
- Flash reason login failed (ie. not authorized)
- Make Account/Delete action a post, preferrably with an authorized Ajax call if it can be done without sending cookies
- Need flash messages (ie. delete user doesn't work)
- Ensure there are no spaces in urls (ie. blog titles)
- Add flash message to Ajax success and failure functions
- Should logout be a Post? (idempotent requests)


Port 25 is allowed in Medium Trust environment. It is blocked by Fios, however.

- I don't like that I have to new up a Mailer everywhere I want to interact with the user. I don't always need to send the user an email.
